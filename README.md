# REACT Portfolio

## Description
For this challenge, I created an interactive portfolio using React. The portfolio is one page with a home, about, portfolio, resume, and contact sections. From the front page, you can click any of the links in the navbar, and the page will scroll to that section. There's links to six of my most complete projects, a contact form that will give a prompt after submission, and social media links in the sidebar.
